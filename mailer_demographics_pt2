/* 
This script creates a basetable for a dashboard on Mailer Demographics for the Campaigns team. The goal of the basetable 
is to summarize demographics of our members for every mailer we've sent since 2020. For each mailer, demographics are 
summarized by engagement type: all recipients, opens, and actions. 

It builds off an intermediary table (coc_reporting.mailer_demograpics_xf) which filtered which mailers to include, 
flagged users who opened or took action on a mailer, and formated demographics into buckets.

See the full WORKFLOW HERE: https://platform.civisanalytics.com/spa/#/workflows/37375/executions/2623479


This script is composed of a series of CTEs which are almost identical, with one CTE for each demographic and engagement 
type (all, opens, actions). Each CTE filters for the demographic and engagement type, then calculates the demographic 
measurement for each bucket as a percent.

The final select brings all of these CTEs together with UNION ALL statements.

Demographics included:
  Age
  Gender
  State
  Household Net Worth
  Highest Education
  Family Composition
  Facebook Score
  Twitter Score
  Healthcare Score
  Progressive Tax Score
  Racial Resentment Score
  Gun Control Score

Table Field names:
  mailing_id
  mailing_date
  campaigner
  campaign_team
  demographic
  categories
  pct (percent)
