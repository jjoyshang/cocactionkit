/*
This table is a supplement to a basetable for a dashboard on Mailer Demographics for the Campaigns team. The goal of the basetable 
is to summarize demographics of our members for every mailer we've sent since 2020. For each mailer, demographics are 
summarized by engagement type: all recipients, opens, and actions. 

See the full WORKFLOW HERE: https://platform.civisanalytics.com/spa/#/workflows/37375/executions/2623479

This table takes the mailers from the basetable and brings in its issue tags. In the dashboard, this will be used as a filter.
Issue tags are in a seperate table since one mailer may have multiple issue tags, which would create duplicates in the base table.
