/*This table attributes demographic fields from the voterfile to users in ActionKit.

Note that not all users in ActionKit could be matched to a person in the voterbase. Therefore, each voterfile record is only 
included for its most recent match to the Activist Pool.

You can query this table by user ids in ActionKit, person ids in the Activist Pool (latest_person_id_match = 1), or 
voterbase ids (latest_voterbase_id_match = 1). */
