/*This query creates a table with mailer metrics, with a field identifying the campaigner who sent it.
For each mailer, it gives a row for each user who received it and whether they opened, clicked, did an action,
or unsubscribed on that mailer. The resulting table has no duplicate users.

The numbers from this query may be slightly lower than the numbers in ActionKit itself. We suspect this is because Civis
takes awhile to sync.
